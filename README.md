# LabVantage-LIMS
Place to store VBA Macros to interact with LabVantage LIMS

Right now it is fairly customized to a specific enviornment and will need to be modified for use in other enviornments.

Assumes the user is logged into LabVantage LIMS in Internet Explorer, but has subs set in case you need tohave the Macro open Internet Explorer and log into LIMS. Again this needs to be modified to be used

Some useful sub routines for interacting with Internet Explorer Objects are inside of the script and can probably be used elsewhere, such as getting an InternetExplorerMedium object based on a the title of different IE tabs and entered text

In order to run this script outside of the included Excel Sheet, the following references need to be added:

Visual basic for Applications
Microsoft Excel 16.0 Object Library,
OLE Automation
Nicrosoft Office 16.0 Object Library
Microsoft Internet Controls
Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library
Microsoft HTML Object Library

Might add more scripts later if anything comes to mind, or I might make this repository a place to store all of the VBA scripts I've created.
